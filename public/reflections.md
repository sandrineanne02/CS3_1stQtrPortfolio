# Be12 GABORNI, Sandrine Anne V.'s Reflection
## List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1.  JavaScript Overview and Syntax - The basic concepts and background information of what JavaScript is was shown here. Simple code format was also discussed in this section.

2. Variable Declaration - Introduction of JavaScript Variables were shown. This lesson also discussed how to declare variables with keywords var, let and const. Data types such as strings, boolean, numbers, undefined, null and symbol were also covered in this topic.

3. JavaScript Basic Statements - Here, some ways o display an output in JavaScript were covered. These ways include alert(), console.log(), document.write() and document.getElementById(id).innerHTML = "text" or id.innerHTML = "text". It was also mentioned that prompt(), and confirm() methods were used to get an input from the user.

4. Control Statements - In this section, conditional statments such as relational and logical operators, if-else and switch statements were covered. Loop was also introduced and said to be further discussed in the next lessons. 

5. Loop Control Structures (while, do..while, for..in) - Here, simple loop statements were discussed such as while, do while and for..in. Definition of infinite loop was also mentioned (declaration of a loop never ends because the conditional expression is never false). 

## List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.
 
1. Loop Control Structures - I get confused with what to put inside the statements.
2. Switch Statements - I mix up the code so my output sometimes turns out wrong.
3. Control Statements - I get confused with how the operators are used.
4. Declaring Functions - I haven't mastered my knowledge for custom functions and how to apply the method.
5. Processing Function Output - Using the return statement sometimes confuses me because I forget how to apply them in the actual code.

## Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

1. I will study more about making JavaScript codes by researching so that I can master my skills in implementing these codes. I will also try practicing coding whenever I can, so that I can still be able to do this in the future. 

## In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

1. Kahoot exercises - This was helpful to me because it helped me remember the concepts and simple codes discussed in the previous lessons. I also got to learn unfamiliar topics through these exercises.
2. Homework exercises - This helped me further understand the code needed to be changed or made. I also got to think more clearly since I was doing it at home. 

1. In-class coding exercises - This was not that effective for me because I had to rush the process of making the code. I also didn't really get to absorb the information that well compared to my first two examples since it was a speed test. (As for the 2nd one, nothing comes to mind that was not effective in my learning. All of them helped me understand code better.)
